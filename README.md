A code in Python that reads the contents of two text files named username and password line by line and selects one line from each file in order and uses it as username and password to login to a website.
In the code we wrote, replace usernames.txt with the name of the usernames file and passwords.txt with the name of your passwords file.
Enter the URL of the site and parameters related to username and password in the corresponding field.
Check the response.status_code to make sure the login is successful.
If needed, you can extend the code to perform various actions after entering the site, such as storing user information or performing other operations.
